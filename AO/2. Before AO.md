# Preface

Although ar.io has shifted to AO, I believe there's still value in understanding how exactly ar.io, gateways and SmartWeave operated in order to evaluate the improvements that the AO migration should bring about.

# ar.io and Gateways

https://ar.io/articles/why-ar-io

As is the case with many blockchain projects, it's unreasonable to expect every user that wishes to interact with the chain to run their own node for that purpose. Gateways, in this vein, are similar to RPC nodes: providing an accessible means for interfacing with a chain by behaving as a proxy.

Arweave gateways are distinct from nodes in that nodes lack any incentivization to serve data, whereas gateways are built for the purpose of data retrieval from the weave with a separate incentive token, $IO (not to be confused with io.net, of course).

Broadly, their functionality includes:
- Proxying chunks and L1 TX headers to nodes
- Construction of bundles
- Retrieval of TX headers and chunks from the weave
- Pricing rates
- Wallet information
- Parsing and execution of data retrieval queries

Gateways are said to be modular in the sense that operators are able to choose the functionalities they wish to serve e.g. enable data retrieval but not indexing of bundles.

## High Level Overview

Gateways act as the intermediate between end users and nodes in a direct, literal sense;
