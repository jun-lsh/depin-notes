## The PermaWeb

So now we tackle some of the big marketing terms out there, like the _Permaweb_. Actually, there isn't much meat to gnaw on: Arweave being a data storage primitive means that you could easily host static websites through Arweave. 

Dynamic websites are, of course, a much more difficult task as there exists no VM to run your backend operations with, so you are pretty limited in what you can accomplish natively with Arweave. You basically have two options:
- Outsource your dynamic operations to a service that exists separate from Arweave altogether
	- For example, this outdated copy of Uniswap [here](https://f7rxm5onif3llazofdk2u3ywru3vplz7l32455thxzk5ldemaelq.arweave.net/L-N2dc1BdrWDLijVqm8WjTdXrz9e9c72Z75V1YyMARc/#/swap)
- Make users upload their Arweave key or connect with Metamask or something so that they will construct a TX to inscribe data onto Arweave through your site 
	- For example, this Pacman demo [here](https://terdkjphf23aagb6wvi5qwwfdcrccivqfbvkx6d5k4dpdg6eyjbq.arweave.net/mSI1JecutgAYPrVR2FrFGKIhIrAoaqv4fVcG8ZvEwkM)

A handy list of webapps built on top of Arweave exists on https://arweaveapps.com/

However, like we've discussed earlier, to access these sites, we run through a gateway which hosts cached copies of these sites. Playing around with these gateways however, it is a pleasant surprise that besides the main `arweave.net` gateway, the other gateways do seem to be working just as well.
