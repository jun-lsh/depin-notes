# A Tour of the Land

In the land of Web3 and cryptocurrencies, decentralized storage has long been a narrative thrown about and one of the more "tangible" and (ideally) easily accessible technologies offered by decentralized systems. 

When everyone was obsessed with NFTs (those without utility beyond being a pointer to an image), [almost half of all those "artworks" were being hosted on IPFS](https://www.rightclicksave.com/article/how-many-nfts-are-actually-on-the-blockchain) (InterPlanetary File System). Even now with the current memecoin craze, your Solana shitcoin token icons are being uploaded to IPFS (pump.fun uses Pinata, an IPFS pinning service, to host token icons via https://pump.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/).

Besides the "free" option of participating in IPFS on its own, we can introduce monetary incentives to participate in the construction of decentralized storage solutions, giving birth to the earliest form of dePIN.

As it stands, decentralized storage solutions with crypto tokens are dominated by the following projects:

- Arweave
- Filecoin
- BitTorrent Token 

I believe there's value in understanding each of these projects on their own and the differences between them as it'll provide us with a good basis to compare newer projects to.
